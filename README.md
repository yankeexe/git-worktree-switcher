## Installation
Download the script from the [Release section](https://github.com/yankeexe/git-worktree-switcher/releases).

Make the script executable.

```bash
$ chmod +x wt
```

Copy the executable to any directory in your `$PATH`

```bash
$ sudo cp wt /usr/local/bin
```

## Tab Autocompletion :zap:

**For Bash**
```bash
sudo cp completions/wt_completion /etc/bash_completion.d
```

Add this to the end of your `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
eval "$(command wt init bash)"
```

**For ZSH**
> Note: completion file for zsh has `_` prefix


Find paths where you can store your completion
```bash
print -rl -- $fpath
```

Copy completion script to one of that location and restart the shell.

```bash
sudo cp completions/_wt_completion <one-of-$fpath>

exec zsh
```

Add this to the end of your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
eval "$(command wt init zsh)"
```

**For Fish**
```bash
cp completions/wt.fish ~/.config/fish/completions
```

Add this to the end of your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
```bash
command wt init fish | source
```
