# AUTOCOMPLETION FOR ZSH
# Reference: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Completion-Widgets.html

# Declare an associative array named `opts`
declare -A opts

# Split the worktree names into an array, line-by-line.
list=("${(@f)$(wt names)}")

# Create associative array with key same as its value
# Completion keywords are taken as keys of arrays and the possible matches are their values
for item in $list; do
	# Escape every element's special characters
	item=$(printf '%q' "$item")
	opts+=(["$item"]="$item")
done

# Add the keys of `opts` as completion options for the `wt` command.
# `-Q` quotes the completion options.
# `-a` specifies that the options are taken from an associative array.
